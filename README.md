# My Tasks (Backend)
This is my first try to put React and Node.js together as a todo list app.
The front end of this app can be found in my other repository [React my tasks](https://github.com/ashish10677/React-my-tasks-MERN)

## How to run
* Clone this repository.
* Clone my React repository mentioned above.
* Run npm start in React repository to start the React App.
* Start the mongodb server and run npm start in the backend repository.
* Goto http://localhost:3000/add-item to add an item.
* Refresh the page after every edit/update/delete to view the changes.
